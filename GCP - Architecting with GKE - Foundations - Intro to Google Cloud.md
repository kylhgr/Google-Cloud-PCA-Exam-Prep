## Introduction to Google Cloud
1. on demand self service, no humans
2. resources accessible anywhere
3. large pools of resource to pool from
4. rapid elasticity
5. pay for what you consumer

###  GCP Compute
- GCE --> VM instances on demand, IaaS
	- flexible
- GKE --> containerized application, managed service
	- package code, portable, orchestrate code
- App Engine --> run code without infrastructure, PaaS
- Cloud Functions --> Serverless, functions as a service
	- scale resources as required, only pay for code when its running

---
### GCP other services
- Database on GCE VM instance
	- install DB engine
- DB service in GKE
	- managed DB yourself
- Big Data
- Machine Learning

#### Resource Management
Zones, regions, multi-region

PoPs and Networking: high throughput, low latency, connection on public internet, edge networks, caching with CDN

Zonal resource, Regional or Multi-regional, Global resourcse (VPC, HTTPS Load Balancers)
