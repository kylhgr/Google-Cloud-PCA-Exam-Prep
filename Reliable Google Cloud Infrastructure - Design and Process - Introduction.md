## Course Introduction
	Which applications to use to efftively implement the applications and services
	
Many services can be interchangeable for a use case!

---
### **Define Application Requirements**

	What is the software supposed to do, who are the users and what is the value
- Rough Draft
- Structure Design *iterate*
- Measurable

---
### **Architecting the application using Microservices**

	Layout of the overall design
- #microservices refers to an architectural style for developing applications
	- large apps decomposed to independent parts
	- agile application for speed

---

### **Choosing the best storage and deployment services**

	How to determine the best services for a Microservice
	
---
	
### **Leverage Google Cloud services for Reliability**

	What are the requirements, which services on GCP are best to meet the applicaitons goals
	
GOALS: optimizing cost & reliability

==Incorporating GCP principles==
1. durability
2. reliability
3. cost
4. disaster recovery

---

### **Design with Security in mind**

	Consider the applications/microservices security requirements
	
What are the appropriate security services for the #microservices requirements?
- security is implemented in layers
	- *security is a shared responsibility*
		- how are the applications configured to be secure

---
### Monitoring the application

	Monitoring the application to determine if the service is meeting the goal
	
**Monitoring Tools**
- Dashboards
- Logs
- Error reporting
- Tracing

1. Start by defining the application requirements
2. Use monitoring tools while developing the solution to determine **how successful are we at meeting the applications goals?**
