# GCP Introduction
## What is Cloud Computing?
1.  **On-Demand Self Service:** No human intervention needed to get resources 
2.  **Broad network access**: Access from anywhere
3.  **Resource pooling:** Provider shared resources to customers: 
4.  The provider benefits from **economies of scale** *by buying in bulk and pass the savings on to the customer*
5.  **Rapid elasticity:** Get more resources quickly as needed: scale up and donw   
6.  **Measured service:** ==Pay only for what you consume==: what you use or reserve

### How did we get here?
1. Physical/Collocation: User-configured, managed and maintained
2. Virtualized: User-configured, provider managed and maintained
3. Serverless: Fully Automated

## Data
==Great software is centered around great data!==
			``Managing Data``
			``Getting value from data``

## GCP computing architecture
#IaaS: raw compute, storage and network organization in a fashion that mirror data centers
-   Pay for what you allocate/reserve

#PaaS: bind application code to libraries that give access to the infrastructure required for application performance and functionality -- focus on application logic
-   Pay for what you use


#IaaS | Hybrid | #PaaS | #Serverless Logic | Manged Resources
----- | ------ | ----- | ----------------- | ----------------
#ComputeEngine | #GKE      #GoogleKubernetesEngine  | #AppEngine | #CloudFunctions | No need to provision manually

## Google Networking
-   Carries about 40% of the world's internet traffic every day
-   Largest of its kind - invested billions of dollars to build it
-   Lowest latency, highest throughput
-   Interconnects at more than 90 internet exchanged, 100 points of presence worldwide
-   Edge network location to provide low latency
    
## GCP regions and zones
**Zones:** ==deployment area for GCP resources==
-   A GCP virtual machine is launched, it will run in a user specified zone
-   Zones do not always correspond to a single physical location/data center
-   Zones are grouped into regions
-   Single failure domain within a region
    
*All zones within a region have fast network connectivity*

**Regions:** ==independent geographical areas==
-   Users can choose the region they want to store GCP resource in
-   Usually have round trip network latency under 5 milliseconds 
-   Best practice to run resource in different regions and multiple zones in a regionÂ  to maintain fault tolerance and availability

**Multi-region:**
- Stores data redundantly in at least 2 geographic locations
	- separated by at least 160 kilometres within a region	
		- ex: Europe Multi-region

#GCP region total: ==15==

## Environmental responsibility
*2% - average electricity used by Data Centers*

#GCP data centers were the first to achieve 14001 certification! (*standard that maps out a framework for improving resources efficiency and reducing waste*)

#GCP most advanced data center location: ==Hamina, Findland== (*cooling system uses seawater to reduce energy waste*)

#Google is the largest purchaser of wind and solar energy & has been 100% carbon neutral since 2007

## GCP pricing
#GCP granularity of billing results in big cost savings for workload that are *bursty*

#GCP services ==billed by the second==
- #GoogleKubernetesEngine 
- #ComputeEngine 
	- **automatically sustained use discounts**
		- automatic discounts for running a VM instance for a significant portion of the billing month (*more than25% of a month*)
	- **Custom virtual machine types**
		- fine-tune VM for their application
		- tailor pricing for workloads

==5 pricing discounts for workloads==
1. **Billing in sub-hour increments**
	- applied to compute, data processing and other services
2. **Discounts for sustained use**
	- Auto applied to VMs using 25% or more a month
3. **Discounts for committed use**
	- Pay less for steady, long term workloads
4. **Discounts for *preemptible* use**
	- Pay less for *interuptible* workloads
5. **Custom VM instance**
	- Pay only for the resources needed for workloads

## GCP open API

Open API | OPen Source Ecosystem | Multi-vendor friendly
---------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
#CloudBigTable #CloudDataproc | #TensorFlow #Kubernetes #ForsetiSecurity | #GoogleStackdriver #GoogleKubernetesEngine 

***avoid being locked into a vendor***
1. #GCP services are compatible with open source products
	- #CloudBigTable uses the interface of the open source database Apache Hbase
		- *code portability*
	- #CloudDataproc open source #BigData environment #Hadoop as a manged service
	- #TensorFlow open source software library for #MachineLearning 
	- #Kubernetes mix and match #microservices running in different clouds *interoperability*
	- #GoogleStackdriver

##### Practice Quiz
1. Why might a #GCP customer user resources in several zones within a region
	- For improved fault tolerance
2. Why might a #GCP customer use resources in several regions around the world
	- To bring their applications closer to users around the world, and for improved fault tolerance
---
## Why choose GCP
***Enables devlopers to build, test and eploy applications on Googles highly secure, reliable and scalable infrastructure & networks***

Prioritize: #Compute #Storage #BigData #MachineLearning and #DevOps services (*mobile, web, analytics and back-end solutions*)

***Open Source Friendly and designed for Security!!***

## Multi-layered security
Layer | Security Measure
------ | ------
Operational Security | Intrusion detection systems, techniques to reduce insider risk, employee U2F use, software development practices 
Internet Communications | Google Front End, designed in Denial of Service protection
Storage Services | Encryption at Rest
User Identity | Central Identity service with support for U2F
Service Deployment | Encryption of inter-service communication 
Hardware Infrastructure | Hardware design and provenance: secure boot stack: premise security |

Security General Points
- Server boards and networking equipment in #Google data centers are customer designed 
- Designs custom chips (*hardware security chips ==Titan==*), deployed on servers and peripherals
- Server machines use cryptographic signatures (*ensures booting to the correct software*)
- Builds our own data centers (*multi layers of physical security*)

## GCP budget and billing
==Tools to monitor pricing and prevent accidental charges==
1. Budgets and Alerting
2. Billing
3. Export(*Store detailed billing information in #BigQuery or #CloudStorage*)
4. Reports and Quotas (*visual tool to monitor expenditure & prevents over consumption*)
	- ***Define budgets per billing account or per project***
		- ==Types of Quotas==
			1. **Rate Quotas**
				- reset after a specific time
			2. **Allocation Quotas**
				- *Both applied at the level of #GCP projects*
				- governs the number of resources allowed in a project (==ie:== *no more than 5 projects*)
	- ***A budget can be a fixed limit or linked to other metrics*** (*% of the previous month spend*)
